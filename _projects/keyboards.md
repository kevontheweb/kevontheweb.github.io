I have already dabbled somewhat in building mechanical keyboards.
My first DIY build was a [handwired split ortholinear](/tech/2020/11/27/split-ortho-handwire-build-guide/).
I am currently deciding whether to build another split keyboard or make something a little more portable.
In the mean time I have been gathering parts and mocking up designs.

You can read about my very-in-progress pi-pico powered dactyl manuform build [here](https://github.com/kevin-nel/pico-dactyl).
As well as my way-too-boxy open-scad designed 3d printed baby-v handwire case [here](https://github.com/kevin-nel/babyv).

## reviung41

I currently daily drive a reviung41 ergonomic 40% keyboard, and I find the small size and ability to use layers has made typing much more comfortable (especially for symbols).

## le chiffre

I have also built a 3D printed and handwired le chiffre 35% keyboard, but it is a little bit small to be practically useful.

here's a family photo 😛 with the le chiffre.

## corne

I recently ordered some PCBs from [jlcpcb]() to build a corne crkbd

## meetups

I also enjoy interacting with others that are interested in custom mechanical keyboards and have been to a few meetups.

## salvaging switches

I managed to salvage around 90 switches from an old mechanical keyboard

## designs

After using an ortholinear for some time I am convinced to keep using ergonomic layouts.

### split

This wonderfully designed 3d printed split on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4003113) with an awesome star wars vibe to it.

### normal

I do miss having a numpad and after using layers don't really miss function keys so these are the two main designs for now.
