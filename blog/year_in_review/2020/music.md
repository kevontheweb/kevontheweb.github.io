title: Some Albums I Like
---

Albums (mostly from bandcamp) that I enjoyed.
I am gradually adding comments to them as they feature in my "Artist Recommendations" on my Bandcamp profile.

- [stray fantasie - mint julep](https://mintjulep.bandcamp.com/album/stray-fantasies?from=footer-nn-a2971886615) shoegazey dreampop with a synthwave flair and som glorious 80s synth lines.
- [holds - jogginghouse](https://jogginghouse.bandcamp.com/album/holds?from=hp) some top notch ambient music right here.
- [bathtub bumps - badsnacks](https://badsnacks.bandcamp.com/album/bathtub-bumps)
- [don't ask - nitemoves](https://nitemoves.bandcamp.com/album/dont-ask)
- [fornax void 90s ambient](https://fornaxvoid.bandcamp.com/album/cyberspace-database)
- [louie zong - jazz](https://louiezong.bandcamp.com/album/jazz)
- [Japanese Breakfast - Jubilee](https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/releases)
- [Sevish - Bubble](https://sevish.bandcamp.com/album/bubble)
- [ipaghost - weeklybeats](https://weeklybeats.com/ipaghost)
- [Sevish - Harmony Tracker](https://sevish.bandcamp.com/album/harmony-hacker) accessible xenharmonic music that plays with your harmonic expectations and introduces microtonal flavours really organically.
who said microtonal music has to be weird!
- [Brian Green - Impressions for Headphones](https://briangreen.bandcamp.com/album/impressions-for-headphones)
- [Mid Air Thief - Crumbling](https://midairthief.bandcamp.com/album/crumbling) Beautiful blend of acoustic and electronic elements with soft airy vocals and nice harmony and melody. I can't wait to see what more comes and how the mid air thief mystery unfolds.
- [Garoad - VA-11-HALL-A Second Round](https://garoad.bandcamp.com/album/va-11-hall-a-second-round)
- [Jonathan Ogden - Twenty Four](https://jonathanogden.bandcamp.com/album/twenty-four) It's a beautifully crafted intimate album, that's just as hifi as it is lofi
- [MUNYA ](https://munya.bandcamp.com/album/voyage-to-mars) wonderfully atmospheric dream pop with an excellent blend of French and English lyrics that only help to further the atmosphere (the Smashing Pumpkin cover is great too!)
- [AYYUKA - Maslak Halayi](https://ayyuka.bandcamp.com/album/maslak-halay) super vibey Turkish instrumental psych rock with microtonal Turkish flair and entrancing grooves.
- [Inner Wave - Apoptosis](https://innerwave.bandcamp.com/album/apoptosis?from=hp) groovey psychedelic pop/rock with elastic basslines, catchy hooks, spacey vocals and a great mix to match. Apostosis is the perfect blend of psychedelic and pop.  This one is a wonderful listen from start to finish.
